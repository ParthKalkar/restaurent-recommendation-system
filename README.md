The Restaurant Recommendation System is a platform designed to help you discover the best dining options in your area. The system utilizes the latitude and longitude of your geographic location to provide personalized recommendations based on your preferences and past dining experiences.

## Functionality

The K-means clustering model is used to group restaurants based on their features and display them on a map. The map is created using Plotly libraries and Geopandas, and allows the user to easily browse through a comprehensive list of restaurants in their vicinity.

## Usage

To use the Restaurant Recommendation System, simply provide your geographic location as input and the system will recommend restaurants based on your preferences. The system is designed to be easy to use and user-friendly, making it a great tool for anyone looking for the best dining options in their area.
